      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of this walkthrough is to teach you how to build a very simple 3D framework for the Comfort Range Values
        talked about earlier. Using Unity and simple primatives we will be able to visualise where these ranges are in
        3D space from a first and third person perspective. The framework only needs to be built once, and can then
        be used as a guide for future VR rapid prototyping.

    <h2>Step 1</h2>
    <p>
      First we need to find a suitable grid to use as a guide inside Unity. For this example we'll use a 360 degree
      polar grid which was taken from etc.usf.edu/clipart/43000/43030/polar_36-10l_43030.html However, you can also
      look to Google Images for other circular grids.

  <section class="section section-dark">
    <h2>Step 2</h2>
    <p>
      Open up Unity, and create a new 3D Unity Project. Then head up into the GameObject menu and select 3D Object, then
      Plane. To be able to put in our grids, we need to first put in a basic primative to attach them to. To reduce
      clutter, we'll do this one at a time.

      Enter 2D mode by pressing the 2D button on the top-left of the Scene Widow. Working in 2D will allow for easier

    <p>
      We want to orientate the plane so we can see it. To do this, change the rotation values under Transform in the
      right hand column so that X is 90, Y is 90, and Z is -90. Now we can see the white plane facing us.

      We simply want to drag the grid image we downloaded before, and drop it into our Assets folder located at the botom
      of the screen. To avoid distraction, turn off the camera tag in the Inspector window for the Main Camera.

    <h2>Step 6</h2>
    <p>
      We want to keep the centre of the grid in mind when designing. First, lets make a base so that we know where 0
      degrees is. Go back up to the GameObject menu and select a Cube from the 3D Object menu. The colour is white,
      so lets change this to make viewing easier. Go down to the Assets folder, right click, and create a material.
      <br/>
      Name the material 'Base' and change the colour to black over on the right hand menu next to 'Albedo.' Now
      drag and drop the material onto your cube so its black. Also rename the cube 'Level.'

  <section class="section section-light">
    <h2>Step 7</h2>
    <p>
      Resize the shape of the cube to be a long thin line with your mouse by pressing the 'Rect tool' located
      on the top left. Also reduce the Z scale to 0.2 so when we flip to 3D, the line isn't too wide.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, you can type dimensions into the scale boxes under the Transform property. Then position
      the bar so that the grid line at 0 degrees sits in the middle of your cube with the 'Move tool.'

    <h2>Step 8</h2>
    <p>
      Its time to create the upper comfort ranges. The head motion that allows for comfortable movement is
      20 degrees upwards from level. Duplicate the cube by pressing 'Crtl-D' and rename the cube to
      'UP 20 Comfort.' Next, Create another material and call it 'Comfort.' Change this material to a bright
      green, and place it on your new cube.

    <h2>Step 9</h2>
    <p>
      Select the 'UP 20 Comfort' cube, and change the Z plane to 20 degrees in the Rotation tab below Transform.
      Now with the arrows, line the cube up using the grid lines as a guide. We now have the upper comfortable
      range.

    <p>
      Duplicate the last item you created, and rename it to 'UP 60 MAX.' Apply a red material to it, and rename that
      material to 'MAX.' Then select 'UP 60 MAX', and change the Z rotation to 60. Line the shape up with the grid as
      before. You now have the maximum upper limit viewing range without straining the head.

      The comfortable downward movement for the head is -12 degrees, whilst the maximum downwards movement is -40
      degrees before straining occurs. Create and align two cubes like before for this, and colour them with the
      appropriate materials.

    <p>
      We now want to create motion ranges for a head turning right and left. Lets start by placing another plane
      into the scene, turning off 2D mode, and changing the x,y, and z values to 0 for the position. Now the
      plane is centered. Then add the circle grid to the plane, and change the Y rotation to 180.

    <h2>Step 13</h2>
    <p>
      Lets duplicate our 'Level' cube which is at 0 degrees, and drag it down under our second plane. And then we
      want to duplicate this item one more time. Rename the first duplicate to 'Right 30 Comfort', and the second
      duplicate to 'Left -30 Comfort.' Apply the Comfort material to both of these duplicates.

    <p>
      Select Right 30 Comfort, and change the Y rotation to 30, and -30 for Left -30 Comfort. To avoid making errors
      with aligning in the 3D view, press the 'Y' above the square in the top right hand corner of the scene. We are
      now in the top view.

    <h2>Step 15</h2>
    <p>
      We now move into making our final framework parameters which are the maximum ranges for right and left head
      movements without strain. Start by duplicating both the Left and Right shapes, and renaming each to
      Right 55 MAX, and Left -55 MAX. Apply the appropriate materials, and change the Y Rotation to 55 and -55
      respectively.

    <h2>Step 16</h2>
    <p>
      To clean up, lets create an empty object from the GameObject menu, and rename it to VR_Vision_Ranges. Then
      put every item except the two planes, directional light, and camera, inside this new object. If we switch
      off the planes by unchecking their boxes in the Inspector panel, we can see our framework in the scene
      cleanly, and move it around where we need it. At this point, also exit the top view.

    <h2>Step 17</h2>
    <p>
      Finally, if we want a quick first person view, we can simply turn the camera tag back on in the inspector menu,
      change the Position values to 0, and change the Y Rotation to 90. This provides us with a very quick and easy
      way to build a comfort range test in 3D space, and we can use this is a base for placing content.
