        <p>
          Below the fold is given to the content that a user must scroll to see. It is usually located
          at the bottom of a browser window, or around 600 pixels from the top of the page. The term was
          created from the newspaper industry in the 1990s, where ‘below the fold’ was literally all the
          content below the fold in the middle of the page. Below the fold content has a less likely
          chance of being viewed since content is hidden when the page first loads up, and is only revealed
          once a user starts scrolling down.
