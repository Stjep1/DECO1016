          Transitions in 2D UX design can be separated into two categories - Realtime, and Non-Realtime.
          For this tutorial, we will be focusing on Non-Realtime animations which occur when a user has
          completed an input, and the animation is played as feedback which ends prior to the next action.
          That is, the animation is in the transitional phase.
          <br/>
          An example of this occurrence is when a user presses a button in an app, or on a website, and a
          animation plays to show that the experience is loading. Though the user is temporarily locked out
          of the experience, they are put at ease by the animation showing the status or time remaining for
          the animation to load.

          Transitions in VR design now take on the role of having to accommodate for 360 degree space, and
          for the most part would also be considered Non-Realtime. Common examples of current movement in VR
          include teleporation, and portals.
          <br/>
          This tutorial aims to encourage designers to start thinking of ‘links’ as a 3D medium where something
          can occur. This in-between space which transitions between two scenes or web pages should be modeled
          off the length of time from 2D transitions, and be interpreted for a 360 degree space. Hover over the
          right image below to learn about 3D transitions.
