        <h2>Gaze Capture 2D to 3D</h2>
        <p>
          Real-time animation is any animation embedded into a web experience or app that plays out
          as the user is looking at it. Often, real-time is intermingled with non-real-time animation.
          An example of this is a square which is changing colours on the screen (real-time), and when
          the user presses it, it transforms into a triangle (non-real-time), with non-real-time events
          being post user interaction. Real-time animations are on the forefront of capturing the initial
          gaze and interest of the user, and holding it there.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Both Samsung Research and AtomHawk both suggest that real-time animation cues are ideal for
          capturing or transferring gaze from one area of the VR FOV to another. This techniques is can
          almost transfer directly from the 2D perspective, since the designer is tasked with creating
          the 3D version.
          <br/>
          The designer will now need to think about how cues can be subliminally added to a scene so that
          they feel natural in a experience or story. An example of this could be a desert scene, where the
          user is exploring a desert environment. The designer, for the point of the story, or another goal,
          may need the user to look from the right to the left prior to interaction. The animation could be
          in the form of a snake, slithering from the right to the left, which would almost certainly catch
          the userâ€™s gaze.  Two different types of cues are Motion, and Holophonic Sounds.
