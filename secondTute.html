      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of this 3D Transition walkthrough is to introduce you, the designer who has worked predominately
        with 2D transitional UX, to designing transitions in 3D. The tutorial will not focus on animation principles,
        or 3D modelling, but rather it will give a higher-level look at what can be accomplished in a 3D space
        using simple techniques.

    <h2>Step 1</h2>
    <p>
      Let's start by creating a new Unity project, and then adding two cubes to the scene. Rename the cubes
      'Scene 1' and 'Scene 2', and create materials for both. Zero out the positions for both cubes, then
      select Scene 2, and change the X Position to -20. We now have a simple layout that shows us two worlds
      or experiences. The space all around these two Scenes is the space we can work with to make an
      immersive transition.

  <section class="section section-dark">
    <h2>Step 2</h2>
    <p>
      To make a simple animation, place in a Particle System which can be found in the Effects menu inside
      GameObject. Rename this to 'Transition.'
      <br/>
      On the right side of the window, you will see the Particle System settings underneath the Transform
      settings. We are going to manipulate some of these settings to create a simple 3D animation. Start
      by looking at the settings in the 'Transition' tab.

    <h2>Step 3</h2>
    <p>
      Let's start by changing the duration of the particle life from the default setting of 5.00, to 10.00,
      and ticking the 'Prewarm' box. Next, we need to change the start life-time to 2.

    <h2>Step 4</h2>
    <p>
      What we want to do now is change the mode of the particles Start Speed from 'Constant' to 'Random
      Between Two Constants', and change the two values to 1 and 5.

    <h2>Step 5</h2>
    <p>
      Next, we need to change the particle Start Size to 1, leave the colour as white, and increase the
      Max Particle amount to 20000.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 6</h2>
    <p>
      Close the 'Transition' tab, and open the 'Emission' tab. We want to change the particles' Rate
      over Time to 100, and add a Burst list by pressing on the small plus sign. In the Count box,
      change the value to 10, and in the Cycles box, change the value to 5.

    <h2>Step 7</h2>
    <p>
      Close the 'Emission' tab, and open up the 'Shape' tab. You can experiment with different shapes
      the particle system mimics in this tab, but for the time being, lets change the Shape to 'Edge.'
      We also want to increase the Radius from 1 to 17.89.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 8</h2>
    <p>
      We need to change the mode the particles move in from Random to Loop. This will allow them to
      move along a fixed path. This can also be seen as a kind of 3D progress bar which is moving
      forward in space.
      <br/>
      Increase the Speed to 3.83 to increase the sense of urgency, and change the Y Rotation value
      to -180. We now have a simple animation that moves from Scene 1 to Scene 2 in a few seconds.
      This animation doesn't encompass the entire space, and that's something that you, as the
      designer will have to evaluate for your own given experience.

    <h2>Step 9</h2>
    <p>
      To make the visuals slightly more appealing, lets add some colour by going down to the
      'Color over Lifetime' tab. Here we are able to choose how many colours we want our particles
      to experience over the course of their life. To pick our colour palette, double click on
      the white colour bar to open the Gradient Editor.
      <br/>
      Here we can see four tabs, two on the top, and two on the bottom. The top two tabs control
      the Alpha percentage, and the bottom two, the colour range. New tabs can also be created by
      double clicking the space underneath the coloured bar.

    <h2>Step 10</h2>
    <p>
      Finally, we want to make a few clean-up changes in the Render tab. Change the particle Sort
      Mode to 'Young in Front', and decrease the Max Particle Size from 0.5 to 0.1.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 11</h2>
    <p>
      To view our transition in first person, we can add a camera from the GameObject menu. Make
      sure you have zeroed out all the Position values, and then change the Y Rotation to -90. To
      view our transition animation, press the Play button located at the top center of the window.
      <br/>
      We've now created a very basic render of how to start viewing and imagining transitions in
      3D space. In this example a fireball moves from one point to another. However, 360 space
      offers a world of opportunities for animation, and in particular trying to bridge the gap
      between 2D and 3D affordances, as well as storytelling, and design for purpose.
