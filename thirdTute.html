      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>
        This walkthrough will aim to teach you a very basic way to create an animation cue in Unity.
        Simple primitives will again be used. We'll use the Comfort Range FOV that we created in
        the first walkthrough as a base for positioning, and try to see if we can get a cube to
        travel from the comfortable range guidelines, to beyond the maximum range lines for a
        situation where our user need to turn their head to beyond their comfort zone.

  <section class="section section-dark">
    <h2>Step 1</h2>
    <p>
      Open the Comfort Range file that you were working on in the first walkthrough, and
      Save Scene As with the name 'AnimationCue.' We want to try to position ourselves just
      behind the end of the green range lines so that we have a good view of the area we
      should place our initial item. If you hold down your mouse wheel, you will be able
      to drag the view to where you need it, and scrolling the mouse wheel will zoom in
      and out of the scene.

  <!-- And again, put in the next section of writing to go with the image -->
  <section class="section section-dark">
    <h2>Step 2</h2>
    <p>
      Now lets create two items which will act like our starting and ending gaze targets,
      and add materials to each. If you have any models you want to add to the scene, go
      ahead, but for simplicity, and to solidify the concept we are using cubes.

  <!-- Now create a section -->
  <section class="section section-light">
    <h2>Step 3</h2>
    <p>
      Jump into the top view and position the end cube so that its just out of the
      maximum recommended comfort range which is 55 degrees, and to the right side of
      the cube.

    <h2>Step 4</h2>
    <p>
      Now lets exit top view and create another object. This time we'll choose a sphere
      which will act as our motion cue. This cue will lead us from our pink starting
      gaze to our yellow end gaze.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 5</h2>
    <p>
      Positional animation is a lot easy to visualise from the top view, so enter the
      top view once more. Next, select your sphere and go to the Window tab at the top
      of the page, and select Animation. A seperate window will pop up and ask you to
      create a file name for your animation. Go ahead and do that now.

    <h2>Step 6</h2>
    <p>
      For simplicity we will concentrate on one Transform property, the position. Press
      the Add Property button, and then the triangle next to 'Transform.' From this
      list, choose Position. When you do so you will see two little diamonds appear
      on your timeline. They are your animation keys. If you press the triangle next to
      'MotionCue:Position', you'll see that there are keyframes represented for all
      three axis: x, y, and z.

  <!-- Now create a section -->
  <section class="section section-light">
    <h2>Step 7</h2>
    <p>
      You'll see that at the 1 second mark, keyframes have been added to the timeline.
      This is done by default. We want to make our animtion 2 seconds, so start by
      deleting those keyframes. Then, with your mouse wheel, scroll to increase the
      time of the animation.

  <section class="section section-light">
    <h2>Step 8</h2>
    <p>
      Let's start animating! The easiest way to move the object when animating is to
      use the Transform arrows (blue,red, and green). Make sure your object is
      selected, then press the keyframe button which is a small diamond, and 0
      seconds. You'll notice that the diamond turns blue. Next, lets move our timeline,
      which is a thin white vertical line, to the 2 minute mark.

  <!-- Now create a section -->
  <section class="section section-light">
    <h2>Step 9</h2>
    <p>
      Now, move your object using the Transform arrows, to just to the right of the
      yellow end gaze object. To input a new keyframe, press the 'Add Keyframe'
      button which is the diamond with a small plus next to it. We can see on our
      timeline that a keyframe has been added with our objects new position.
    </p>

  <!-- Now create a section -->
  <section class="section section-light">
    <h2>Step 10</h2>
    <p>
      Go back to 0 seconds by pressing the button to the left of Play. When we press
      Play, we can see that our object travels in a diagonal line from the Starting
      Gaze cube to the Ending Gaze cube. This is a simple animation to allow you to
      understand the purpose of a motion cue for capturing attention in a 3D space.
      <br/>
      As a further challenge, try adding more motion cues to the scene. Additionally,
      try changing the animation position, rotation, and scale, as the motion cue
      travels from its starting location to the target.
